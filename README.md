I am currently studying software development in CIT. After I discovered my passion for writing code, I can not wait to bring this passion into a full time roll! I love creating applications filled with functionality and reliability. Creating the user interface is the part I enjoy the most. I have created many different applications and programs during my time in CIT, each one was as exciting as the next! The feeling of accomplishment that comes when I look back on some of my work is amazing and I can not wait to feel that more and more.
